<h3>New Spot (group project)</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/mmarianaamy/SwiftiesAppReal">New Spot</a> is an innovative iOS app designed to help users understand and reduce the ecological impact of their daily habits. By analyzing user data, the app calculates the water, energy, and carbon footprints generated by individual actions. Using AI, NewSpot provides personalized, gradual recommendations to help users minimize their environmental impact. In addition to tracking everyday habits and activities, users can log their supermarket purchases by scanning items, as well as upload utility bills to calculate emissions. The app even estimates the environmental footprint of driving to a specific location, offering a comprehensive approach to sustainability. The app was developed in Spanish, as it was intended to be used in Mexico.<br>

<h3>App Intents Demo (individual project)</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/jorgelso/App-Intent-Demo-Full">App Intents Timer Demo</a> is a simple yet practical iOS app designed to showcase the functionality of Apple's App Intents framework. Created as part of a workshop for participants with varying levels of experience in Swift and SwiftUI, this demo app allows users to set a timer via Siri and integrate it with automations to restrict access to specific apps. Its purpose was to provide a hands-on introduction to App Intents, demonstrating how developers can enhance app interactions with Siri, Spotlight, and automation. The app was made with simplicity in mind, ensuring that even beginners with no SwiftUI experience could engage with the framework and understand its potential for creating more seamless user experiences.
